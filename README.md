## ✨ Key Features

-   **Interactive Chart:** Press on individual bars to highlight them and display their specific value.
-   **Dynamic Data:** The chart generates and displays data for any given month and year.
-   **Month-by-Month Navigation:** Easily navigate between different months to see historical data.
-   **Live Theme Selector:** Change the entire component's color scheme on the fly with a smooth, animated selector.
-   **Data Summary Cards:** At-a-glance cards that display the Average, Total, and Peak values for the selected month.
-   **Clean Architecture:** The main component is broken down into smaller, reusable sub-components (`StatsCard`, `MonthNavigator`, etc.) for better maintainability and scalability.
-   **Custom UI Components:** Built with a custom, reusable `Button` and `Text` component library, demonstrating a design system-oriented approach.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

-   **Framework:** React Native (Expo)
-   **Charting Library:** `react-native-gifted-charts`
-   **Navigation:** Expo Router
-   **Styling:** StyleSheet, Expo Linear Gradient
-   **UI:** Custom, reusable components built from scratch.
-   **Fonts & Icons:** Expo Fonts, Expo Symbols

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project was born out of a challenge faced in a larger application where charting libraries caused dependency conflicts. The goal was to isolate the problem of data visualization and solve it in a clean, controlled environment.

This project demonstrates:
1.  Proper installation and implementation of a complex data visualization library.
2.  Strong skills in refactoring a large component into smaller, manageable pieces.
3.  The ability to create a polished, interactive, and visually appealing user interface.

## 🛠️ Core Libraries

This project was built using a powerful set of libraries to achieve its look and functionality:

-   **`react-native-gifted-charts`**: For creating beautiful and interactive bar charts.
-   **`expo-linear-gradient`**: Used to create the smooth, elegant background gradients.
-   **`react-native-svg`**: A required dependency for rendering vector graphics in charts.
-   **Expo Router**: For file-based navigation.
-   **Expo Symbols**: For using Apple's SF Symbols as icons.
