## 🎯 Project Goals

This project was born out of a challenge faced in a larger application where charting libraries caused dependency conflicts. The goal was to isolate the problem of data visualization and solve it in a clean, controlled environment.

This project demonstrates:
1.  Proper installation and implementation of a complex data visualization library.
2.  Strong skills in refactoring a large component into smaller, manageable pieces.
3.  The ability to create a polished, interactive, and visually appealing user interface.

## 🛠️ Core Libraries

This project was built using a powerful set of libraries to achieve its look and functionality:

-   **`react-native-gifted-charts`**: For creating beautiful and interactive bar charts.
-   **`expo-linear-gradient`**: Used to create the smooth, elegant background gradients.
-   **`react-native-svg`**: A required dependency for rendering vector graphics in charts.
-   **Expo Router**: For file-based navigation.
-   **Expo Symbols**: For using Apple's SF Symbols as icons.
